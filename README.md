# Ozempic Payment Impact Analysis Project 📊

## Overview

Welcome to the Ozempic Payment Impact Analysis Project! Our goal is to analyze and predict how different factors influence the financial aspects of Ozempic treatments. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, this project aims to unveil key determinants that affect the costs incurred by patients undergoing Ozempic therapy.

## Project Objectives

- **Identify Key Cost Drivers** 🔍: Determine which factors, such as patient demographics, provider details, and treatment specifics, significantly influence the cost. 
- **Predictive Modeling** 🧮: Develop a predictive model to estimate the financial impact of various variables on the treatment of Ozempic.
- **Cost Management Insights** 💡: Provide actionable insights to healthcare providers and patients on optimizing and managing treatment expenses.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection** 📁: Aggregate data from diverse sources focusing on patient demographics, healthcare provider information, and treatment details.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📈: Conduct a thorough analysis to understand patterns and correlations within the data.
- **Model Development** 🛠️: Build a regression model to predict and analyze the impact of different variables on treatment costs.

## Key Findings

- **Geographical Variations** 🌍: Zip code-based variations highlight the economic disparities in treatment costs.
- **Age Factor** 🧓👵: Minor increments in cost are associated with increasing patient age, emphasizing the demographic influence on healthcare spending.
- **Provider Influence** 🏥: Significant cost differences are attributed to specific healthcare providers and organizations, underscoring their role in cost efficiency.

## Conclusion

The Ozempic Payment Impact Analysis Project sheds light on the multifaceted nature of healthcare economics, focusing on how various factors culminate to influence the financial burden of Ozempic treatments. Through predictive modeling and data analysis, this project assists stakeholders in making informed decisions to manage and potentially reduce the costs of healthcare.
